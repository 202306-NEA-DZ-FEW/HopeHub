          HopeHub was founded by a group of Re:coded students in 2023. It was called HopeHub Online and started as a blog and an online community where approved therapists shared their research and ideas. We launched the Beginners Guide to Therapy and our first study, and that hub of industry expertise transformed into a small consulting firm and led us to create the Online Therapist of today!
